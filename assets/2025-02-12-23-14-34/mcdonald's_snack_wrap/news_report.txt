**McDonald's Announces Return of Beloved Snack Wrap in 2025: A Culinary Comeback**

*Fast Food Fans Eagerly Await the Resumption of a Cult Favorite*

December 5, 2024 — Fast food enthusiasts are celebrating the long-awaited return of McDonald's Snack Wrap, a beloved menu item that has garnered a cult following since its discontinuation in 2016. Joe Erlinger, President of McDonald's USA, confirmed the news during an interview on "Good Morning America," stating that the wraps will make their comeback in 2025, although a specific date was not announced for competitive reasons.

The Snack Wrap, originally launched in 2006, combines seasoned chicken breast, torn lettuce, cheese, and ranch sauce wrapped in a warm flour tortilla. Its popularity soared among consumers for its convenience, affordability—priced around $2—and flavorful taste. Erlinger referenced the numerous emails he received from customers urging the company to bring back the wraps, indicating a strong public demand that had been persistent over the years.

Despite the Snack Wrap continuing to be available in Canada and a few other markets, its removal from U.S. menus was due to preparation difficulties, as reported by former corporate chef Mike Haracz. Many fans expressed disappointment when the wraps disappeared, leading to campaigns and petitions—one reportedly accumulating over 18,000 signatures—calling for their return.

The announcement of the Snack Wrap coincides with McDonald's broader strategy to enhance its chicken offerings, with CEO Chris Kempczinski emphasizing the chain's optimism about tapping into its chicken market. The introduction of a new line of chicken offerings in the U.S. is expected to complement the return of the Snack Wrap, as the fast-food giant recognizes a significant opportunity for growth in this category.

In addition to bringing back the Snack Wrap, McDonald's is preparing to unveil a new "McValue" menu starting January 7, 2025. This menu is set to feature popular meal deals and offers focused on providing more value to cost-conscious consumers. Among the highlights will be the continuation of the $5 Meal Deal and a "Buy One, Add One for $1" promotion. 

As excitement builds on social media, fans have taken to platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to share their enthusiasm for the Snack Wrap’s revival. Comments such as “The world is healing” and “This is a dream come true!” illustrate the fervent anticipation surrounding its return.

With the fast-food chain replenishing its menu with fan favorites following a challenging period marked by an E. coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounders, McDonald's is making strides to lure customers back into its establishments with familiar tastes and new offerings. 

As QSR Magazine highlighted, "The return of the Snack Wrap aligns perfectly with our ongoing efforts to cater to consumer demands and reestablish the brand's strength within the competitive fast-food landscape."

For fans eagerly awaiting their opportunity to indulge in the classic Snack Wrap once more, 2025 holds the promise of delicious nostalgia and fresh culinary offerings from McDonald’s.
