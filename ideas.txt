# random notes 2-17 on algo improvement:

- "weight" articles parsed based on recency (more recent articles are weighted more heavily)
- news sources miss things social media has --> should hit some of those APIs
- can help daniel by creating targeted sora prompts 
- can help daniel by creating grok prompts for specific images

# Alterations to algo, 2/24
- shorter length per scene, but more scenes
- each scene should be more exciting/dramatic/crazy

# My thoughs on how to do that:
- make script with GROK not GPT-4o --> this will make asset generation downstream much easier
