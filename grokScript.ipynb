      "**Title: Autopen Controversy Heats Up as Trump Challenges Biden's Pardons**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Date: March 18, 2025**\n",
      "\n",
      "In an escalating feud over the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s final pardons, former President Donald Trump accused his predecessor of signing these legal documents with an “autopen,” claiming that such actions render the pardons “void, vacant, and of no further force or effect.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's assertions, posted on his Truth Social account, particularly target preemptive pardons granted to members of the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol insurrection. He stated, “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\" This comment fueled speculation about Biden’s cognitive abilities and his control over the executive powers of the presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the autopen, a mechanical device designed to replicate signatures, is a practice that has been common among U.S. presidents for decades. Legal experts and former governmental practices affirm that the use of an autopen does not undermine the validity of the documents signed. A 2005 memorandum from the Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush explicitly stated that the President does not need to personally affix their signature for a bill or pardon to be legally binding, as long as the document is signed at the direction of the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics argue that Trump's claims are unfounded and circulate a narrative that fails to recognize established legal precedent surrounding presidential pardons. Jeffrey Crouch, a politics professor at American University, noted, “Biden’s pardons are highly unlikely to be revoked because of the apparent use of an autopen. The plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limitation.” He emphasized how numerous past presidents, including Barack Obama, have utilized the device without any legal repercussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The public discourse surrounding Trump’s claims has led to sharp rebuttals from former members of the January 6 committee, including Adam Kinzinger and Adam Schiff. Kinzinger, responding to Trump’s social media diatribe, encouraged Trump to “bring it on,” asserting that the committee members remain steadfast in their work despite Trump’s threats. Schiff echoed this sentiment, emphasizing pride in their actions during the committee’s investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public focus on the autopen controversy coincides with broader concerns over President Trump’s legislative focus and economic management, as recent polls indicate mixed approval ratings regarding his handling of the economy since returning to office in 2025. \n",
      "\n",
      "While Trump’s allegations are primarily couched in rhetoric, they signal his ongoing commitment to challenging Biden’s legacy, especially as his administration dealt with significant political turbulence surrounding the January 6 events. Notably, Trump has previously utilized similar powers of clemency during his administration, sparking discussions on the political motives behind presidential pardons.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Trump now boldly suggesting investigations into the pardons issued by Biden, observers note that the implications of these statements could prolong the historically contentious relationship between Trump's administration and Biden's legacy, setting the stage for further legal and political battles ahead. \n",
      "\n",
      "As this saga unfolds, it becomes more than just a political dispute over signatures; it raises larger questions about executive power, accountability, and the nature of democracy itself in the United States.\n"

By siding with Republicans to keep the government running, they have handed Trump and his cronies the power to dismantle crucial federal agencies without oversight.
